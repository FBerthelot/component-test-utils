# Contributing

If you don't respects those rules, it's not a big deal. You are free to contribute as you want. It's always helpful !

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

For our git commit messages, we try to use rules that makes sense for us. The main thing is to have a type for every commit with **an emoji** ðŸ¤ 

### Commit Message Format

We are also using [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) along with the [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) and [gitmoji changelog](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog). Follow the instructions there to install it and start using it in our project !

Your commit message needs to start with the type, followed by the subject like so :

```
<gitmoji> <subject>
```

## <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Open a pull request (PR) every time you are developing a feature or modifying something in the project.
