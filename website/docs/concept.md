Component-test-utils is an opinionated test framework.

## Why should you use it ?

It mocks your favorite framework in a way that allows to write sustainable and functional oriented tests of your components.

Because component-test-utils consider each component as a black box, you won't be able to get access to your components state.
It will force you to make assertion on the generated view.

## My Favorite framework is supported ?

- _React_: Yes !
- ... more is coming

That's all at the moment. If you want your framework in this list consider contributing to this project [on github](https://github.com/FBerthelot/component-test-utils) :)
